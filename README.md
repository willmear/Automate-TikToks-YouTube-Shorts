# AutomateTikTok

Automates the creation of videos from the AskReddit subreddit.

Relies on a background video already being present in your files.

Automates the uploading of YouTube Shorts using the YouTube data API from Google - Restricted to (I believe) 10 uploads a day.

Difficult to be granted a TikTok API key so currently does not implement this.
